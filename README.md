## Research Onramp - Learn Some Python
#### Weekly

### Introduction

- My approach to introducing **Programming** for research is widely based personal opinion and years of experience. However, programming for research has an infinite number of solutions, and almost all them are ok as long as your learning!  My approach in these meetings will give you skills beyond using a single software package to get the job done. It is a little `computer sciency` (it's a word!) but you will all be better for it!
- Part of my approach is using the **Command Line** (even on windows).
- This gives the user a better "feel" for the file system, and gives them the ability to install software or fix settings at a higher (or more expert) level. 
- More to come ... 

### Repo Files
