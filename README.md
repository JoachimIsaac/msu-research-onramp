## Research Onramp - First Meeting
#### 02-15-2020 (Saturday @ 2:00 p.m.)

### Introduction

- My idea to introduce **Programming** for research is widely based personal opinion and years of experience.such a broad idea, it's almost funny. So, my approach to getting everyone started to do research (or simply learn another skill aka programming)  
- Using the **Command Line** (even on windows) gives the user a better "feel" for the file system, and gives them the ability to install software or fix settings at a higher level.
