## Research Onramp - Learn Some Python
#### Weekly

### Introduction

- My idea to introduce **Programming** for research is widely based personal opinion and years of experience.such a broad idea, it's almost funny. So, my approach to getting everyone started to do research (or simply learn another skill aka programming)  
- Using the **Command Line** (even on windows) gives the user a better "feel" for the file system, and gives them the ability to install software or fix settings at a higher level. 

### Command Line

- IF your running windows 10, try this: [install ubuntu](BashShell.md)
- If your machine is too old (but still has windows 10) try this: [install ubuntu](BashShellOld10.md)
